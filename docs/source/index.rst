Welcome to PyRidge's documentation!
====================================

This starting project is aimed to write an useful machine learning library in Python based on
the Ridge classification algorithms. Public repository can be seen in
`Github <https://github.com/cperales/PyRidge>`_. These algorithms can be known in the literature
also as Extreme Learning Machine, and they are explained as a type of a feedforward neural
network where some neurons does not require to be tuned by calculating them. Algorithms are the same
and they achieve to a reasonably good solution.

The library is organized in the following way:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   generic
   algorithms
   functions
