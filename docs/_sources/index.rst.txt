Welcome to PyELM's documentation!
=================================

This starting project is aimed to write an useful machine learning library in Python based on
the Extreme Learning Machine algorithms. Public repository can be seen in
`Github <https://github.com/cperales/PyELM>`_. Extreme Learning Machine is type of a feedforward neural network where some
neurons does not require to be tuned by calculating them.

The library is organized in this way
